    <li><strong>American Cuisine</strong>: Characterized by a moderate distribution across all nutrients, but particularly stands out for its saturated fat content. This likely stems from the frequent use of animal fats and processed foods prevalent in American diets.</li>
    <li><strong>Asian Cuisine</strong>: Displays lower levels of saturated fat and sugar, aligning with the traditional emphasis on lean meats, vegetables, and minimal use of sugars. However, its protein and sodium content are relatively high, indicative of the liberal use of soy sauce and other protein-rich sources like seafood and poultry.</li>
