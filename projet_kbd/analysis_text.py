cuisine_evolution ="""
This chart tracks the evolution of different cuisines from 2002 to 2010, revealing diverse trends in culinary interest:<br><br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>African Cuisine</strong>: Demonstrates a clear upward trend, reflecting a rising interest in African dishes, possibly due to increased cultural exposure and availability on the site.</li>
    <li><strong>American Cuisine</strong>: Shows a decline over the years, suggesting that although it dominates, there's a shift towards exploring more diverse culinary options among the user base.</li>
    <li><strong>Asian and Italian Cuisines</strong>: Exhibit volatility, highlighting consistent appeal and possibly seasonal or trend-based fluctuations.</li>
    <li><strong>Greek Cuisine</strong>: Experiences a sudden spike in 2010, indicating a growing interest that could be driven by specific trends in that year.</li>
    <li><strong>Mexican Cuisine</strong>: Features significant variability with notable peaks in 2004 and 2008, followed by a sharp decline in 2010. This decline correlates with the increase in other cuisines such as <strong>Greek</strong> and <strong>African</strong> cuisines in the same year, suggesting that the rise in popularity of these cuisines may have diverted interest away from Mexican dishes, as users explored and embraced different flavors and culinary traditions.</li>

cuisine_calories = """
The chart above reveals that all featured cuisines have average calorie counts ranging between 260 and 320 calories, indicating a general uniformity in caloric content across these diverse global cuisines. This suggests that while individual dishes may vary, the overall energy provided by servings from these cuisines is consistently moderate.
Italian cuisine stands out with the highest average calorie count, likely due to the frequent use of calorically dense ingredients like cheeses and creams, along with potentially larger portion sizes.

cuisine_time_analysis = """
This bar chart displays the mean preparation times for dishes from various cuisines as recorded on Food.com. These average times, ranging from 30 to 40 minutes, indicate that the recipes from these cuisines on the website generally do not involve highly complex preparations. <br><br>
<ul>    
    <li><strong>Asian and Greek Cuisines:</strong> Show the shortest preparation times, both just under 30 minutes, suggesting these cuisines favor simpler and quicker recipes. Common Asian dishes like noodles and stir-fries, and Greek dishes such as Greek salads and grilled meats, typically require less preparation, contributing to the lower average times. <br></li>
    <li><strong>Italian Cuisine:</strong> Has the longest average preparation time at about 40 minutes. This extended time could be due to the prevalence of dishes that require slow cooking methods, such as risottos and certain pasta sauces, or recipes that use fresh ingredients needing more meticulous preparation.</li>

cuisine_nutritions = """
The chart above details the percentages of daily values (PDV%) for several nutrients across different cuisines:<br><br>

<ul>
    <li><strong>African Cuisine</strong>: Exhibits high levels of sugar and carbohydrates, indicating a diet rich in sweeteners and starchy ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>American Cuisine</strong>: Characterized by a moderate distribution across all nutrients, but particularly stands out for its saturated fat content. This likely stems from the frequent use of animal fats and processed foods prevalent in American diets.</li>
    <li><strong>Asian Cuisine</strong>: Displays lower levels of saturated fat and sugar, aligning with the traditional emphasis on lean meats, vegetables, and minimal use of sugars. However, its protein and sodium content are relatively high, indicative of the liberal use of soy sauce and other protein-rich sources like seafood and poultry.</li>
    <li><strong>Greek Cuisine</strong>: Maintains moderate levels of protein and fats with carbs being slightly lower. The nutritional balance reflects the Mediterranean focus on diverse, balanced ingredients like olive oil, fish, and fresh produce.</li>
    <li><strong>Italian Cuisine</strong>: Stands out with the highest protein levels among the cuisines, which is significant. This could be attributed to the frequent use of meat, dairy products like cheese, and legumes in Italian recipes. Italian cuisine is also high in carbohydrates, owing largely to staple foods like pasta and bread, and shows considerable saturated fat levels due to the use of rich cheeses and cured meats.</li>
    <li><strong>Mexican Cuisine</strong>: Known for its high carbohydrate and protein content, driven by staples such as beans, corn, and a variety of meats. The sodium levels are also elevated, likely due to the generous use of spices and seasonings that define Mexican culinary traditions.</li>
